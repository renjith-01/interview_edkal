Coding round of Interview with Edkal

As per the recording ( 	AmazonAddToCart_recording.7z), all files should be contained in Interview.zip
But, as Git limits the file size to 25 MB, I had to take out and checkin selenium server stand alone as a separate file.
Here are the steps to run.

1. Unzip 'Interview.zip' as Interview folder
2. Unzip 'selenium-server-standalone-3.12.0.jar.zip' as 'selenium-server-standalone-3.12.0.jar'
3. Place selenium-server-standalone-3.12.0.jar file into Interview/InterviewProjectAmazon/lib
4. Go back to 'Interview' folder
5. Click on 'run_amazonCart.bat' file.
